Official list
There is was an official list available in the GitHub Docs at
https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#displaying-badges-on-your-profile (link to the archived version).
There is still a section which includes specifics on how badges were/are awarded, e.g. which repositories and versions qualified for the Mars 2020 Helicopter Contributor.

Consider this repository a mirror, maybe in the future with historic purpose. Unless there will be an official list again, this is it.
